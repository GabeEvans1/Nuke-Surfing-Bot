Important Notes: This only works with 1080P for now. 
                 Your open map keybind must be CAPSLOCK
                 This is prone to not working due to the fact that it uses pixel RGB matching for most of the processes.
                 This is my first program ever, so I'm most likely overlookng many, many things.
                 
                 
If this gets more than a dozen downloads I'll work on new features such as: 2k and 4k support, custom zone selection tool, profile saving, less-error prone search methods, and much more.

This program will automatically queue you into a game, look at the map and compare it to your selections, and backout/re-queue if no match is found.
